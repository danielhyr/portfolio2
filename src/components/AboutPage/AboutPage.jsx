                                Well, maybe it really is true; building has always been my passion, and after all, what is more exciting to build than the closest thing to magic there is in the real world?

                               <p className="atext__paragIns">I am always eager to learn, hungry for improvement, and passionate about every task that is at hand - yes, I can code for long, long hours on end, without stopping!    <br>
                               </br>  And I can honestly tell you that It will always be that way, just because I love writing code; there's nothing quite as cool as this thing.</p>
